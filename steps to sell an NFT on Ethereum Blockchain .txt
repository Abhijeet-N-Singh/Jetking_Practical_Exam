here in this note. Sir, i am going to show you How to sell an NFT on Ethereum Blockchain.

we have created NFT, it time to sell it .for doing this we need to log on the marketplace, open your collection and locate the NFt you wish to sell.

select the nft and click on the "Sell" button underneath, this click will take to the page where you get to pick the price and the mode of sale.

you gonna decide the price that has to be fixed or run an auction.

you also have to choose the tokens you want to be paid in, on OpenSea you can only recieve Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens.

Click on the "Edit" button to dtermine the token you want to be paid in. 

you have to decide that if you want that royalties on NFT or not.

confirm your setting and your NFT's are for sale on the market place.

  you will then be notifiedn if anyone decides to buy to your NFT.

Cresting and listing NFT's for sale costs some Ethereum , so you need to ensure that your Ethereum wallet is funded ahead of time.
